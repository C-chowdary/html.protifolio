    <h2>I am a Web Developer!!</h2>
    <hr/>
<p>Through the utilization of HTML,
I have done two distinct projects each showcasing the versatility and creative potential of this fundamental language. 
The first project, a Birthday Invitation, serves as a personalized digital greeting, inviting recipients to partake in joyous celebrations. 
Meanwhile, the second project, a compilation of the "Top 3 Movies," offers a curated selection of cinematic masterpieces.
Both projects not only demonstrate the technical prowess of HTML but also highlight its capacity to transform ideas into interactive and captivating web content.
